        <p style="margin:0">Hello,<br><br>

            We're looking forward to your participation in the upcoming Westeros-Essos Cyber Summit.
            <br><br>
            To help you prepare and get the most out of the summit, we've assembled some read-ahead materials covering key topics. These resources are intended to provide background context, highlight current trends, and frame the discussions we'll have during the event.

            You can access the materials via the included zip attachment. Please take some time to review the documents before the summit.
            <br><br>
            If you have any questions or issues accessing the materials, don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you, and we look forward to an engaging and productive summit.
            <br><br><br>
            Best,
            <br>
